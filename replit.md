# Overview

This is a Global Travel Advisory application that aggregates travel alerts and country information from various sources. The application allows users to search for countries and view current travel advisories, security alerts, and background information including demographics, economy, and cultural details. It's built as a full-stack web application with a React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React with TypeScript**: Single-page application using React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite Build System**: Modern build tooling for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Routing**: Client-side routing using Wouter library for lightweight navigation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API server with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations with PostgreSQL
- **Data Storage**: Abstracted storage interface supporting both in-memory (development) and PostgreSQL (production)
  - **Connection Validation**: Database connections are tested with 5-second timeout before route registration
  - **Graceful Fallback**: Automatically falls back to in-memory storage if database connection fails
  - **Startup Logging**: Clear console messages show database connection status and storage mode
  - **Health Monitoring**: `/api/status` endpoint reports database connection health
- **Data Fetching Services**: Modular services for fetching data from external travel advisory APIs
- **Background Scheduler**: Automated data refresh system with three schedules:
  - Alerts refresh: Every 6 hours for recently accessed countries
  - Background data refresh: Every 7 days for country metadata
  - **Weekly Bulk Download**: Every Sunday at 1 AM for all US State Department advisories (200+ countries)
- **Bulk Download Service**: High-performance download manager with production-ready features:
  - **Batch Processing**: 5 countries processed concurrently for 5x speed improvement
  - **Retry Mechanism**: 3 attempts per country with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s delays)
  - **Timeout Controls**: 30-second timeout on all AI API calls to prevent stuck requests
  - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time job status with per-country success/failure tracking
  - **Error Recovery**: Automatic job resumption after server restarts with checkpoint restoration
  - **Expected Performance**: ~2-3 minutes for full 234-country download (vs 8+ minutes sequential)

## Database Design
- **Countries Table**: Core country information (name, code, flag URL)
- **Alerts Table**: Travel advisories and security alerts with severity levels, includes AI-enhanced fields (keyRisks, safetyRecommendations, specificAreas)
- **Background Info Table**: Demographic and economic country data with unique constraint on countryId
- **Bulk Jobs Table**: Tracks weekly download jobs with progress metrics, status, and error logs
- **Relational Structure**: Foreign key relationships linking alerts and background info to countries
- **Error Recovery**: Production-ready error handling prevents server crashes from database connection failures

## API Structure
- **Search Endpoint**: `/api/search` - Accepts comma-separated country names and returns comprehensive country data
- **PDF Export**: `/api/export/pdf` - Generates formatted PDF reports with AI-enhanced travel advisories
- **Bulk Download Management**:
  - `POST /api/refresh-advisories` - Manually trigger bulk download of all US State Dept advisories
  - `GET /api/refresh-status/:jobId` - Check progress of running or completed bulk download jobs
  - `GET /api/refresh-history` - View history of past bulk download jobs
  - `POST /api/refresh-cancel/:jobId` - Cancel a running bulk download job
- **RESTful Design**: Clean API design following REST principles
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Request Logging**: Middleware for logging API requests and responses

## Data Management
- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Combines data from US State Department, UK FCDO, and other travel advisory sources
- **Automatic Refresh**: Three-tier scheduling system:
  - Recently accessed countries: Every 6 hours
  - Background metadata: Every 7 days
  - **Complete US State Dept database**: Weekly (Sundays at 1 AM) with AI enhancement for all 200+ countries
- **AI Enhancement**: ChatGPT integration analyzes full advisory pages to extract key risks, safety recommendations, and specific areas of concern
- **Persistent Caching Strategy**:
  - All downloaded data stored in PostgreSQL cloud database for persistence
  - Search queries check cached data first, only fetch online if no cache exists
  - Automatic storage selection: PostgreSQL when DATABASE_URL exists, in-memory for local dev
  - Cache-first approach ensures fast response times and reduced API calls
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and validation
